-  **operating system** 操作系统—like Windows, macOS, or Linux 
-  **shell** *is simply the outermost layer of an operating system. It's designed to provide a way for you to interact with the tools and services that your operating system provides.*  shell只是操作系统的最外层。它的目的是为您提供一种与操作系统提供的工具和服务进行交互的方式。 
-  **Graphical User Interface** or **GUI** (pronounced "gooey") ,  A user interface where you give instructions to the computer by interacting with things like windows, menus, icons, and buttons. 用户界面，通过与窗口、菜单、图标和按钮等交互向计算机提供指令。 
-  **Command-Line Interface** or **CLI**, A user interface where you give instructions to the computer by entering lines of text.  一种用户界面，你通过输入几行文字来给计算机指令。 
-  One of the most widely used shells is called **BASH**
